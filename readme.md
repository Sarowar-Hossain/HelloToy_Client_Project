# Project Name: helloToy.Com
Project Description:

This project is a React application that implements client-side routing using the react-router-dom library.
The application provides a user interface for managing toys, including browsing, adding, and viewing toy details.
It also includes features like user registration, login, and a blog section.

# Live Site Link:

The live version of this project can be accessed at Live Site Link https://toy-clients-sarowar-hossain.vercel.app/

# Project Structure:

The project follows a modular structure, with different pages and components organized in separate directories.
The main entry point of the application is the App.js file, which serves as the root component.
The pages directory contains individual page components such as Home, AllToys, AddToys, MyToys, Blog, Login, Register, and ProductDetails.
The private directory includes a PrivateRoute component to handle protected routes that require authentication.
The NotFound component is used to display a 404 error page for any unrecognized routes.

# Routing Configuration:

The project uses the createBrowserRouter function from react-router-dom to create the router instance.
The router is configured with different routes, each containing a path and corresponding element component to render.
Some routes are protected using the PrivateRoute component to ensure that only authenticated users can access certain pages.
The ProductDetails route also includes a loader function to fetch data dynamically based on the provided product ID.

# Dependencies and APIs:

The project relies on the react-router-dom library for client-side routing.
It may have additional dependencies for other React-related packages, such as state management or UI libraries.
The ProductDetails route utilizes the fetch function to retrieve data from an external API endpoint related to the specified product ID.

* Note: The actual live site link and specific details about the project may vary depending on the implementation and hosting environment.
